{"body":"#Flux Balance \r\nThis project hosts the SBW Flux Balance Module. The program supports the [SBML Level 3 Flux Balance Proposal](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/Flux_Balance_Constraints_%28fbc%29), and so is able to read SBML files. \r\n\r\n![SBW Flux Balance](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/2012-11-11_-_FBA.png)\r\n\r\nThe program uses [LPsolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net) as solver, and can so solve reasonably sized problems without any issue. \r\n\r\nWith the latest [SBW version](http://128.208.17.26/fbergman/files/latest/SetupSBW.exe) installed, the program also allows to import Jarnac or [COPASI](http://copasi.org) files!\r\n\r\n##Download\r\nA windows installer is available from the downlod site, grab it here: \r\n\r\n* <https://github.com/downloads/fbergmann/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.3.exe>\r\n\r\n![Logo](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/fba_icon.png) \r\n\r\n##Previous Versions\r\nThe [first version](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/2009/03/fluxbalance-analysis-with-sbw.html) of the tool is still available from my [blog](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/), but essentially superceded by this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/sbml-logo-70.jpg\" /></div>\r\n![PoweredBySBW](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/SBW%20Logo-transparent.png) \r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
