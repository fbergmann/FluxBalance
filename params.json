{"name":"FluxBalance","tagline":"This application supports the SBML L3 Flux Balance format and allows creating / analyzing flux balance problems stated in that format.","body":"#Flux Balance \r\nThis project hosts the SBW Flux Balance Module. The program supports the [SBML Level 3 Flux Balance Proposal](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/Flux_Balance_Constraints_%28fbc%29), and so is able to read SBML files. \r\n\r\n![SBW Flux Balance](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/2012-11-11_-_FBA.png)\r\n\r\nThe program uses [LPsolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net) as solver, and can so solve reasonably sized problems without any issue. \r\n\r\nWith the latest [SBW version](http://128.208.17.26/fbergman/files/latest/SetupSBW.exe) installed, the program also allows to import Jarnac or [COPASI](http://copasi.org) files!\r\n\r\n##Download\r\nGithub no longer supports binary releases. So starting with 1.8 they will be available from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/upload/modules/FluxBalance/). The current version is:  \r\n\r\n* Version 1.9: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/files/modules/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.9.exe/download> (Corrected SBW export, added menu item, to allow to send L2 or L3 models to SBW).\r\n\r\n* Version 1.8: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/files/modules/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.8.exe/download> (New is additional export of SBML Level 2 Models using either FBA or COBRA annotations).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Previous Versions\r\n[Version 1.7](https://github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/raw/master/releases/SetupFBA-1.7.exe) import of COBRA annotations, re-designed LP generation, so it will work for *large* models.\r\n[Version 1.5](https://github.com/downloads/fbergmann/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.5.exe), fixed issues with L3 package annotations in L2 models.  \r\nThe [Version 1.4](https://github.com/downloads/fbergmann/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.4.exe), fixed issues with import from L2 annotation of FAME!  \r\n[Version 1.3](https://github.com/downloads/fbergmann/FluxBalance/SetupFBA-1.3.exe), the first version from github is still available!  \r\nThe [first version](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/2009/03/fluxbalance-analysis-with-sbw.html) of the tool is still available from my [blog](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.com/), but essentially superceded by this project. \r\n\r\n![PoweredBySBW](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/SBW%20Logo-transparent.png) \r\n![PoweredBySBW](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/FluxBalance/master/images/sbml-logo-70.jpg) \r\n \r\n## License\r\nThis project is open source and freely available under the [Simplified BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license.
