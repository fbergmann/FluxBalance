#Flux Balance
This project hosts the SBW Flux Balance Module. The program supports the [SBML Level 3 Flux Balance Proposal](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/Flux_Balance_Constraints_%28fbc%29), and so is able to read SBML files.

The program uses [LPsolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net) as solver, and can so solve reasonably sized problems without any issue. 

With the latest [SBW version](http://128.208.17.26/fbergman/files/latest/SetupSBW.exe) installed, the program also allows to import Jarnac or [COPASI](http://copasi.org) files!
